Yes, this is a post about cohost shutting down.
Since it was the only general social media website i enjoyed using i've set up my website to be a blog again.
<!--more-->

## Other Social Media
Sure there are some sites i definitely enjoy going to like Newgrounds or some forums, but none of them are a general page where i can just put whatever. So this website will have to do.

It _is_ also a little exciting that so many people are setting up RSS feed readers again.
Someone also made a [huge list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BCJ7PFpUEjaysOA4C77z9Ckdo0YbutPihTh7oimm2AA) of blogs (and blog adjacent things) by ex cohost users.

## Exciting new Website
The design of the site hasn't changed a ton, but i've swapped out my own bare bones CMS (that was really just a json file) for Nuxt Content since it is comfy and easy to use. It also comes with exciting experimental features that definitely won't break anything like searching! I've also used this in the past including for a university project i got a 1.7 on so it's definitely good.

One thing that this website can't do that was nice about cohost is comments, so for your convenience i have added an email button at the bottom of every blogpost.
You can use it to send me an email about my posts. Retro, i know, but everyone has email and i'll be really happy about it. Of course there are also other ways to contact me with links on the frontpage.
