Yes, this is a post about cohost shutting down.
Since it was the only general social media website i enjoyed using i've set up my website to be a blog again.
<!--more-->

## Other Social Media
Sure there are some sites i definitely enjoy going to like Newgrounds or some forums, but none of them are a general page where i can just put whatever. So this website will have to do.
It is nicer for it to be a proper blog again rather than just a link collection anyways.

## Exciting new Website
The design of the site hasn't changed a ton, but i've swapped out my own bare bones CMS (that was really just a json file) for Nuxt Content since it is comfy and easy to use. It also comes with exciting experimental features that definitely won't break anything like searching! I've also used this in the past including for a university project i got a 1.7 on so it's definitely good.

One thing that i hope the new CMS will do is make it easier for me to write public stuff on here since i don't have a great outlet for that anymore anywhere else.

One thing that this website can't do that was nice about cohost is comments, so for your convenience i have added an email button at the bottom of every blogpost.
You can use it to send me an email about my posts. Retro, i know, but everyone has email and i'll be really happy about it. Of course there are also other ways to contact me with links on the frontpage.

## Lessons to be Learned (???)
On one hand it's really sad to see cohost go.
It's refreshing to see a website in our current internet landscape that isn't actively trying to make everyone suffer and strive for eventual world domination.
Even better if that website is run by four queers on nothing but passion and pure hubris.
Then of course it's a little bit of a punch to the gut that this project has to come to an end just purely due to bad luck and the usual capitalist hellscape shenanigans (in this case with stripe) and it makes me wonder if well intentioned passion projects like this _can_ even succeed or if you have to exploit **someone** to be successesful.

On the other hand it _is_ also a little exciting that so many people are setting up RSS feed readers again.
Someone also made a [huge list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BCJ7PFpUEjaysOA4C77z9Ckdo0YbutPihTh7oimm2AA) of blogs (and blog adjacent things) by ex cohost users.
The [musicians of cohost discord](https://discord.gg/TZqW4XAX) ~~shameless self plug~~ is super fun too.
There is also a real sense of community with many people trying not to loose accquaintances they made on there.

I have a feeling it will at least do some good with many people being inspired to learn more about the web and seeing that a thing like this **can work**.

May everyone trying to make a better web have more luck next time. o7
