Ever wanted to know how to get pico 8 running on an Odroid Go Ultra?
<!--more-->

first buy pico 8

go to itch.io and download the raspi version of pico 8. pico 8 was in the blm bundle. everyone has that one so you probably own it already too.
put it in your roms folder

now extract the contents of the folder called pico-8 into the pico-8 roms folder on your sd card. not the bios folder... i struggled with this...
it works now, congratulations

play the games. you love the games.
