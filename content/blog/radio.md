Recently i set up an internet radio station! I've already written a mission statement on that website, so these are some more personal thoughts on it.

The radio station is at [radio.kittycat.homes](https://radio.kittycat.homes). It's something i wanted for myself for a while. As a listener as well as as a musician. When you check out the popular music websites like bandcamp or spotify right now discovery really isn't great, at least if you're a smaller artist. Youtube works alright imo but it's very high effort and requires you to pay constant attention at all times. On some level that's cool because that's how you listen ideally, buuut maybe it's my adhd but i straight up cannot do it unless there's a cool music video.

DJ Mixes have been a good way for me to discover things recently, but they're not really meant for discovering new things. Most of the time there's no links, and sometimes there's not even track id. Being bound to YouTube isn't great either.

They're also usually types of music I'd listen to anyways. Like I'll put on a ukg or drum and bass mix while working and it's fun and cool, but it's not really breaking any boundaries in my musical taste. Which yk that's good there's nothing wrong with comfort food, but knowing my usual cycle I'll get really tired of a genre after listening to it too much. In my later teens i listened to so much punk music and then couldn't stand it at all for a few years. I'm slowly warming up to it again and don't get annoyed by it anymore, but i still don't usually listen to it on purpose. Which is sad!
With french house and hip hop I've always been listening to a little bit of it, but not too much so i never burned out on those which is nice. So yeah having a variety of music to listen to is important.
