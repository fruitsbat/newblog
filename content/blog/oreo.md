Got a super cheap new lens n went out with my friend Jose to take pictures.
<!--more-->

After i was done with work we met up in the city center at a nice boba place called Pankai.
They actually had really good matcha.
After trying it a couple of times i never enjoyed it, but only ever tried making it at home.
So this one was awesome.

A day before that i got a package from ali express.
It was a new lens!
![the lens on my camera, it really looks like an oreo cookie, they even have the filling](/image/oreo/oreo.webp)
It's super silly honestly, but so much fun.
There's no focus on it at all and its constant aperture.
From what i understand these use the same lenses as disposable camera.
Some even claim that they're upcycled from dispo cams, but no clue if that's true.
Anyways i paid 14 euros for this its awesome.
There's also a company called retropia who dropship these for around 50 and apparently heavily advertise on instagram.
I know its not TECHNICALLY a scam bc ur getting exactly what u got promised but come on that sucks.
You could get a [7artisans ufo](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005008083705475.html) or one of the [sg image hypno kink lenses](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005007766084990.html) for that price.

This lens is super great honestly.
I also had the sony 35mm f/1.8 oss with me just in case and ended up using that for 5 minutes and then putting the oreo back on because it was just more fun.
It's also just really tiny which is nice.

We also saw some geese hanging out near the river in the city center.

100% the goose is involved in the car accident, but we still love it, its awesome goose.

This goose is learning to be human by imitating one. It's a mistake, don't do it goose.

Did you know they have architecture in the city center?
I know. I was suprised too.
