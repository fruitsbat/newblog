Chilling at the river with my girlfriends and my first lost lens cap. We also saw THE boat. Gwen says she has wild wasteland irl.

Waow this was a week ago already! I needed to fix my website first it was truly fuuukced.
Anyaways it was awesome. One of the first nice warm days this year.

I did lose my lens cap for the Meike 50mm f/0.95 tho. Which is a tragedy.
But also not very suprising. 
It stuck onto the lens with only hope. 
No screws or clamps or anything.
Doesnt matter too much i got a new one that clamps onto the filter threads on ali express.
The only problem is it's taking ages to arrive and that means i cannot bring my favorite lens anywhere until then.

This is gwen looking at something, not sure what it was.
Honestly i'm pretty sure she just pretended not to see im taking a picture of her.

Julias hair being cool. It's just like that, no clue how it works tbh

Its the hitting things with hammers factory where they do REAL work for REAL men.
This is where they build the communism.
This is also around where i must have lost the lens cap.
You can try to find it so when i'm a famous artist in the future it will be worth millions.
Its not a very good lens cap tho. Good luck!

This is why i like the meike lens so much like what the fuck is happening here.

![cool rocks in the water! they were much larger irl than they look here](/image/2025-05-31/stones.webp)
These were actually much larger than they look in the picture.
Small boulder the size of a big boulder.

![the boat! its the ever given omg](/image/2025-05-31/boat.webp)
Big boat stuck?????
Ok it didnt get stuck again that would've been too lucky.
But it feels almost like we summoned it cuz while watching boats we were joking about the ever given.
And then it just showed up that RULED.


These are all shot on the meike 50mm f/0.95 cuz my bag only fits one lens. Or two really small ones. But this one is only medium small.
I also figured out that it looks really vibey to just ignore white balance.
Just have it set at 5600k and it will be awesome.
