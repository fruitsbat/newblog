The post is called "first link roundup!" because it's a subtle way of forcing myself to do more of this in the future.

## sortition social
Hey i heard you like syndication so i put some syndication in your syndication.
[sortition social](https://suricrasia.online/sortition/) is a site displaying recent feeds from some randomized (?) blogs! I've found some cool stuff this way. The best thing about it is that you can also subscribe to it in your feed reader. So it's like dual syndication.
You can also sign up to this if you feel like it ü§´

## garage hearts
Looove (this ep)[https://b-trx.bandcamp.com/album/garage-hearts], got it suuuper late honestly. Last bandcamp friday ((sorry coda))[https://codarobo.online/].
Anyways been listening to it a lot.

## avoset has a newgrounds now
If you read my old posts you see i already remixed one of her songs so you know her already. [And now she has finally made a newgrounds!](https://avoset.newgrounds.com/)

## hoptix!
[i love this video game!!!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2544100/hoptix/) Have been playing it on my steam deck and it's really cool!

## this website with cool pixel fonts 
[Honestly the url for this looks super dodgy so i thought it was a phishing thing when i first found it](http://www17.plala.or.jp/xxxxxxx/00ff/). Buuuut what this actually is is a really pretty looking website with cool pixel fonts. Get positively surprised üëç
