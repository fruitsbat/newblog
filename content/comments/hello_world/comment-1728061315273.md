this blog post is awesome!!! i think ur reflection around the end of cohost was rly nice to read. building a nicer future will never be easy and only gets harder as capitalism becomes more hellish... but seeing all these blogs popping up from people who want to keep in touch without having to rely on toxic social media is really smth that fills me with hope!

i really hope that ppl will keep up with their blogs and their rss feeds. ive always thought the biggest barriers were 1) it being too hard to post, and 2) no one else having blogs. its lonely when all you have in your rss reader is like 2 people. but now there's so many tools that can make posting to a blog more accessible, and there's a lot of people setting up their blogs cuz of cohost's shutdown! it has me hopeful :)
